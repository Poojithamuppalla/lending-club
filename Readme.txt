This Project is based on Prediction of Interest Rates of Loans from the Lending Club Loan Data.
The pdf file is including in the folder.

Setup the path first, all the dataset should be export and import from Jupyter notebook folder.

The notebook required jupyter notebook, there will be some plots disappear if using JupyterLab due to some setup problem.

Be careful about re-run the code, it will take at least six hours.

Data: loan.csv is the original data; test.csv used for the final test and feature.csv used for feature selection
Data Visualization.twb explained some basic data in the loan.csv, not including all the data visualization
If there has path error, just change the path to the loan.csv

Probably need to setup toggle output, but some output will be too long.
